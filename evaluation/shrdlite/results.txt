Evaluation results for the Shrdlite system
==========================================

- With the spatial planner: 783/909 = 86.1%

- Without the planner: 468/909 = 51.5%

Note: The grammar is ambiguous and relies heavily on the spatial planner to filter out candidates.
Without the planner, 42% of the utterances are ambiguous with between 2 and 14 trees,
but with the planner, only 4 utterances are ambiguous (i.e., 0.4%).


Error analysis
--------------

Almost all of the errors that the system makes are of two forms that are extremely easy to correct:

- Initial puncutation: None of the training sentences start with a sequence of periods, 
  but 58 of the evaluation sentences do. This means that the parser fails already at the
  start of the sentence.

- The word "cell" does not occur in the training sentences, but in 45 of the evaluation sentences.
  The parser tries to correct each occurrence of "cell" into the Levenshtein-similar "cube",
  which has a totally different semantics than the "tile" type that it should have.


To test this, I did two very small changes to the grammar:

- To allow an initial sequence of periods.

- To add the words "cell" and "cells" to the lexicon entry for the "tile" type.


With these two extremely minor additions to the grammar, I get the following results:

- With the spatial planner: 886/909 = 97.5%

- Without the planner: 521/909 = 57.3%

Note: The grammar still relies on the planner to do a good work, but with it the result is remarkable!


Result files
------------

All results are in the directory "results". Each file is one run, and the filename should be pretty self-explanatory. The summaries are at the end of each file.
